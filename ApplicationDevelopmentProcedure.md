# Application Development Procedure #



The "Application Development Procedure" suggests: Before working on your [Application Code](ApplicationDevelopmentProcedure#Application_Code.md) make sure you have specified the requirements of the application in a [Specification Document](ApplicationDevelopmentProcedure#Specification_Document.md), and, you have defined an [Application Coding Standard](ApplicationDevelopmentProcedure#Application_Coding_Standard.md). The following diagram illustrates the "Application Development Procedure":

## Application Code ##

A list of "Application Code" examples that follow the "Application Development Procedure":

  * [Login Example](LoginExample.md)
  * [Religion Chooser](ReligionChooser.md)

## Specification Document ##

A list of "Specification Documents" that specify the requirements of the underlying application:

  * [Login Example Spec](LoginExampleFeatureSpec.md)
  * [Religion Chooser Spec](ReligionChooserFeatureSpec.md)

## Application Coding Standard ##

An "Application Coding Standard" consists of a set of [Nanoarchitectures / Architectural Patterns](ApplicationDevelopmentProcedure#Nanoarchitecture_/_Architectural_Pattern.md) which describe the structure of your application, and, some coding guidelines collected in a [Coding Conventions](ApplicationDevelopmentProcedure#Coding_Conventions.md) document.

### Nanoarchitecture / Architectural Pattern ###

The definition of "Nanoarchitecture / Architectural Pattern" will be explained [here](Nanoarchitecture.md).

### Coding Conventions ###

A list of "Coding Conventions" that have been used in the "Application Code":

  * [Flex 3 Coding Conventions](Flex3CodingConventions.md)
  * [Flex 4 Coding Conventions](Flex4CodingConventions.md)
