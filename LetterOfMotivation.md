# Letter of Motivation #

Here I'd like to explain the reason why I have created these code examples:

## Code Examples ##

  * [Login Example](LoginExample.md) written in Flex 3 and Flex 4.1 (MX, Spark) and Flex 4.5 (Spark)
  * [Religion Chooser](ReligionChooser.md) with Flex 4.1 (Spark)

## Why have I created these code examples? ##

  * I desirably love coding Flex :)
  * When applying for new jobs as Interaction Designer or Flex Developer I usually show my clients these code examples so that they can evaluate if my Flex skills are of need to them.
  * Because I haven't found any comparable Microarchitecture examples like this, I decided to create them myself.
  * I'd like to get feedback from the Flex community to improve the way I am suggesting coding Flex.
  * I am trying to give Flex beginners the opportunity to compare existing Flex SDKs and Microarchitectures so that they can speed up their development time, and thereby, using less bad coding practices.
  * For the moment, I see the need to point out certain things that should be improved in future versions of Apache Flex ... for more information please read this page ["What's wrong with Flex?"](WhatsWrongWithFlex.md).
